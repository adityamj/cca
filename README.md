# cca

cca is a simulator for spread and progression of HPV infections. This is written in C and utilized functions from GNU Scientific Library and libconf.

Launching the executable without any parameters returns the list of accepted parameters.

Current simulations so far have not produced interesting results. I am still tweaking the transition functions.
